"""Enforce the five-differences contract between this template and the public one.

`README.md` states that this repository is permitted to differ from
`tannergolden/path` in exactly five ways, and that "any difference outside these
five is drift, and drift is a defect". That was held by prose alone, and prose
does not fail a check - so it drifted.

This reads `.github/template-parity.yml`, compares the two trees, and fails on
anything the contract does not permit.

Usage:
