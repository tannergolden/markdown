"""Outlined lettering, so a file looks the same on every screen.

A README image cannot load a web font, and the viewer's system font differs by
platform, so every letter is drawn as a path. The outlines are data under
`data/fonts/`, each file with its font's licence beside it; `infra.resources`
reads them and hands them in with `use`, because this module does no I/O.

Six faces, each with the one-letter prefix its glyph ids start with:

  serif      Cinzel Bold: titles, engraving, anything that should feel struck
  meta       Barlow Condensed SemiBold: prose, captions, the terminal line
  num        Barlow Condensed Bold: the heavier cut, for a title that shouts
  mono       JetBrains Mono Regular: paths and code in the elements
  sans       DejaVu Sans Book: the standard theme's prose
  sans-bold  DejaVu Sans Bold: the standard theme's capitals, as a badge sets them

The two sans faces are the badges' own letters: a badge names Verdana, and
DejaVu Sans is the face a screen without Verdana draws it in.

Each SVG embeds only the glyphs it uses, once, and places them with `<use>`.
Nothing is set as `<text>`: every letter on a page is a path.
