"""Every design, and every file it draws.

A design is drawn as up to six files, named the way the siblings name theirs:
`-day` for GitHub's light theme and `-dark` for its dark one.

  header-day.svg          header-dark.svg          the ordinary case
  header-still-day.svg    header-still-dark.svg    reduced motion, only for a design that moves
  header-narrow-day.svg   header-narrow-dark.svg   a phone; always still

A footer draws the same six as `footer-*.svg`, plus one pair per link in its
links row, `link-<label>-day.svg` and `link-<label>-dark.svg`, because an
image in a README can carry only the one link that wraps it.
