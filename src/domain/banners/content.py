"""What a header and a footer carry, and the alt text that says it.

A header follows the standards' header matrix, less its emoji: a FULLY CAPPED
title, a bold one-line description (the tagline here), an italic principle
(the motto) with up to two more general notes after it, and optionally a
longer description. Under them runs a row of figures, each a label and a
value: the repository or the account, then what GitHub says about it (the
release, stars, forks, followers and so on).
`compose` fills all of it from a measurement; nothing here knows where the
values came from. A footer follows the footer composition: a closing
phrase, the way back to the top, and the attribution line.

Every field can be switched off. A field that is off is neither drawn nor
spoken: the alt text is built from exactly what the image shows.
