"""What a run draws and writes, and the commit that records it.

`plan(measurement, config)` is the whole of a run that does not touch the
network or the disk: it composes the header and the footer, draws every
file, and writes the two README blocks. `run`, `render`, `check` and
`preview` all go through it, and so does the preview page, under Brython,
which is why it is pure.

The commit message says what the banners now show and what moved since
the last drawing, so no two refreshes read alike, the way trophies' do.
