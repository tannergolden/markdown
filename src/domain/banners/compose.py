"""A measurement and a config, as the header and the footer the designs draw.

Every value on a banner comes from one of two places: what GitHub says
(the measurement) or what the config says. A field the config leaves
empty is filled from GitHub; a field it sets wins; a field it lists under
`hide` is not drawn at all. So a consumer who writes nothing gets a banner
that reads their repository or profile, and keeps reading it as it
changes, and one who writes a title keeps that title.

  title        the config's, else the repository's name, or the person's name
  tagline      the config's, else the repository's description, or the bio
  motto        the config's, else in profile mode the status message: the
               sheet's first general note
  notes        the config's, up to two more general notes, numbered after
               the motto
  figures      the ones the config names, in its order, else the mode's
               defaults; one whose value GitHub does not have is left out
  footer       the handle, the licence and the last change, from GitHub;
               the closing phrase from the config
  links        up to four buttons under the footer: the config's, else
               the first four pages a developer reaches for: a
               repository's own on GitHub, or a person's website and
               profile tabs

Text is drawn as outlines from a fixed set of letters, so measured text is
made drawable first: a dash the standards ban becomes a hyphen, a GitHub
`:shortcode:` is dropped, and a character no face holds is left out, with
a note saying so. A header draws no emoji: one a description or bio
opens with is taken off the tagline quietly, since it was never meant as
a letter. The alt text is built from what is drawn.

This module is pure, like the rest of the domain.
